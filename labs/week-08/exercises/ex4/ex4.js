// create an array where every element contains a colour of the rainbow
// using a for loop change the index containing 'violet' to uppercase




// initialize an empty array
// using a do...while push any number you like into the array
// once the array contains 15 indices break the loop




// using a while loop, loop through the previously created array of 15 elements and console log every index that contains an odd number



// using a for..of loop delete every even number found in the now mutated array
