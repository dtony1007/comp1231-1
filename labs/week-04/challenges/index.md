# Week 04 - Working With Control Statements

## exercise 1
1. create 3 variables with 3 different values
2. create an if statement for each one
3. create a condition for the if statements
4. have all if statements evauate to true
5. All evaluated if blocks should print a console.log

## exercise 2
Rinse and repeat. Copy the code you've completed above and have all conditions evaluate to false

## exercise 3
Write code that captures the date just as in exercise 3. Compare the dates and capture the current time. When you're done, it should look just as I did. Or better. We will be talking about Dates and objects shortly so here is a brief introdcution. Don't worry about the values. just look at how the syntax for the logic is used. 


# The Lab Test

> :squirrel: The lab test instructions again

1. You will be given a variable. You must determine that variables data type. If you make a correct typeof comparison, enter the if.
2. In the if statement, you will use the random number defined for you, and with that number, you must figure out what it's value is using an `if/else..if/else` statement. console logs in the if block just like we've been practicing.
3. Once inside the evaluated if statement, you must assign any value you like to a value predefined called  `toBeDeclared`.

```js
const email = 'someone@somewhere.com'
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)
let toBeDeclared
```
