## Embedding JavaScript

> :squirrel: Taking what we learned in lab, please complete the following challenges.

# COMP1231 - Exercise Week 02

1. Create an HTML document in your week-03 folder 
2. Create a JS file called index.js
3. Import index.js into your HTML document
4. Inside the index.js 
  - `console.log('it works!')`
5. Declare 3 variables
   - 1 var variable with a value (number)
   - 1 let variable with a value (string)
   - 1 const variable with a value (boolean)
6. `console.log(var1, var2, var2)`
7. Using your three variables, test the data type of the variable using the `typeof` operator for each variable.
8. After checking the type of your 3 variables and having the conditional statement evaluate to true, create two new variables.

```js
// use these variables in your code
let course
let classTime = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
```

9. Use if/else if and else to determine what range the number is in
10. If the number is between 0-25 console log 'The number was between 0 and 25', else if the number is between 26 and 50, print that the number is between 26 and 50. If the number is between 50 and 99, console log again, this time that the number is between 50 and 99.
