# Week 04 - Working With Control Statements

## exercise 1
1. create 3 variables with 3 different values
2. create an if statement for each one
3. create a condition for the if statements
4. have all if statements evauate to true
5. All evaluated if blocks should print a console.log

## exercise 2
Rinse and repeat. Copy the code you've completed above and have all conditions evaluate to false
